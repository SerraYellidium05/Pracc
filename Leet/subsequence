A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false







/*class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int j=0;
       for(int i=0;i<t.length();i++){
        if(s.charAt(j)==t.charAt(i))j++;
        if(j==s.length()){
            return true;
        }
       }
       return false;
    }
}
*/
/*


here we put the pointer only to the t string not
to s so as me check the first char to the full t 
we move to the next of s till last if
the lenght of j and s are same then we have accepted hence true else false
